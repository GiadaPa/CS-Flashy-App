# Flashy-App-
Flash cards application for assignment 1


The app starts with an introduction to what spaced repetition is.
With the press of the "show deck button" the list of decks is shown.
Decks can be selected by pressing on their name, as well as deleted by pressing on the "delete deck" button below the deck's name, or renamed by pressing on the "rename deck" button, which prompts to another component containing the text input form to renaming the deck.
An "add deck" button is shown at the bottom, with which a new deck can be added to the list of decks by inputting the name of the new deck in a textinput component.
When a deck is pressed the first question is shown, as well as a "restart" button, which shows the first card of the deck again and makes the whole exercise restart, a "delete card" button, which deletes the card and a "back to decks" button, which prompts back to the list of all decks.
By pressing the "show answer" button the back of the card is shown, which contains the answer.
Then a "correct" and an "incorrect" buttons are shown and by pressing one of the two, the current card is added to the corresponding deck.
At the end of the deck a "show results" button appears and by pressing it the results are shown, as well as a "exercise again" button, which makes the exercise restart with all the wrong cards, and an "add card" button, with which a new card can be added to the current deck.
If there are no more incorrect cards a "back to deck" button is shown and by pressing it, it will prompts back to the list of decks.

(the timer operations to re-sort the cards in the deck were not implemented!)
